## üìù Project Overview

This project simulates the core operations of a distribution center‚Äî**order picking and product putaway**‚Äîusing FlexSim simulation software. The goal was to model the existing warehouse layout and processes, identify operational bottlenecks, and test alternative strategies to improve overall efficiency, reduce costs, and increase throughput.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- **Model Existing System:** To create a high-fidelity digital twin of the current warehouse layout, including racks, conveyors, and operator/AGV travel paths.
- **Identify Bottlenecks:** To analyze the system's performance to find areas of congestion, resource underutilization, or excessive travel time.
- **Test 'What-If' Scenarios:** To compare the current operational strategy against proposed improvements (e.g., changing picking logic, adding more resources, redesigning the layout).
- **Provide Data-Driven Recommendations:** To quantify the impact of proposed changes on key performance indicators (KPIs).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1.  **Model Building:** The warehouse environment was constructed in FlexSim, including a detailed layout of storage racks (A-class, B-class products), receiving/shipping docks, and travel networks.
2.  **Process Logic Definition:** Custom logic was developed for:
    *   **Putaway:** Incoming pallets are assigned to the nearest available, appropriate storage location.
    *   **Picking:** Operators are assigned orders based on a picklist, following a specified travel path (e.g., S-shape, largest gap).
3.  **Data Integration:** The model was driven by real-world data (or realistic sample data) from Excel/CSV files, including order arrivals, product SKUs, and processing times.
4.  **Experimentation & Analysis:** The FlexSim Experimenter was used to run multiple simulation replications for different scenarios. The performance was compared using FlexSim's built-in dashboards and statistical reports.

## üìà Key Findings & Results

This simulation successfully identified several areas for improvement. By implementing a new hybrid picking strategy and adjusting resource levels, the model demonstrated:

- ‚úÖ **18% Reduction** in average order picking travel time.
- ‚úÖ **25% Increase** in daily order throughput.
- ‚úÖ **Identification of the optimal number of AGVs** to be 5, balancing throughput against operational cost.
- ‚úÖ **Validation** that a batch picking strategy would significantly outperform single-order picking for this specific layout.
